# markdown-preferences/code-fence-style

> enforce a consistent code fence style (backtick or tilde) in Markdown fenced code blocks.

- ⚙️ This rule is included in `plugin.configs.standard`.
- 🔧 The `--fix` option on the [command line](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface#fixing-problems) can automatically fix some of the problems reported by this rule.

## 📖 Rule Details

This rule enforces a consistent style for code fences (fenced code blocks) in Markdown.\
Markdown allows both backtick (` ``` `) and tilde (`~~~`) code fences, but mixing them can reduce readability and maintainability.\
This rule detects code fences that do not match the specified style (default: backtick) and reports them. It can also automatically fix them if desired.

**Why enforce a consistent style?**

- Ensures a unified look and editing experience across the project
- Prevents rendering or parsing issues
- Makes collaboration and integration with other tools easier

**About autofix**

- The type of fence (backtick/tilde) can be unified automatically
- The length of the fence (3 or more characters) and the language specifier are not changed
