# markdown-preferences/no-heading-trailing-punctuation

> disallow trailing punctuation in headings.

- 💡 Some problems reported by this rule are manually fixable by editor [suggestions](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/core-concepts/#rule-suggestions).

## 📖 Rule Details

This rule disallows ending Markdown headings with punctuation marks such as `.`, `,`, `;`, `:`, `!`, `。`, `、`, `，`, `；`, `：`, `！`, `｡`, or `､`. Headings in Markdown are typically used as section titles or anchors and are not meant to contain sentence-ending punctuation.

Adding punctuation at the end of headings can lead to inconsistent visual style, affect readability, and result in undesirable anchor IDs in rendered HTML (e.g., `#why-use-this-?` instead of `#why-use-this`).

### Examples

#### Default Configuration

```md
<!-- eslint markdown-preferences/no-heading-trailing-punctuation: 'error' -->

#### With Custom `punctuation` Option

<!-- eslint-skip -->

```md
<!-- eslint markdown-preferences/no-heading-trailing-punctuation: ['error', { punctuation: '.!' }] -->

<!-- ✓ GOOD -->

# FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions

## What is this?

<!-- ✗ BAD -->

# This is a heading.

```

#### With Level-specific `punctuation` Option

<!-- eslint-skip -->

```md
<!-- eslint markdown-preferences/no-heading-trailing-punctuation: ['error', { punctuation: { default: '.,;:!', '4-6': '' } }] -->

<!-- ✓ GOOD -->

# This is a main heading

#### This sub-heading can have punctuation.

##### Another sub-heading with punctuation!

<!-- ✗ BAD -->

# This is a main heading.

## This is a section.
```

### When Not to Use

- If your project uses headings that intentionally end with punctuation for stylistic reasons
- If you're working with documentation in languages that require specific punctuation conventions

## 🔧 Options

```json
{
  "markdown-preferences/no-heading-trailing-punctuation": [
    "error",
    {
      "punctuation": ".,;:!。、，；：！｡､"
    }
  ]
}
```

- `punctuation` (optional): A string of punctuation characters to disallow at the end of headings, or an object with level-specific settings. Default: `".,;:!。、，；：！｡､"` (includes ASCII and CJK punctuation).

### `punctuation` (`string`)

A string containing punctuation characters that are not allowed at the end of headings. Each character in the string is treated as a disallowed punctuation mark.

**Default:** `".,;:!。、，；：！｡､"`

The default includes:

- ASCII: `.` `,` `;` `:` `!`
- CJK fullwidth: `。` `、` `，` `；` `：` `！`
- CJK halfwidth: `｡` `､`

Note: Question marks (`?` and `？`) are not included by default because they are commonly used in FAQ-style headings.

**Example:**

```json
{
  "punctuation": ".!?"
}
```

This configuration would only disallow periods (`.`), exclamation marks (`!`), and question marks (`?`) at the end of headings, while allowing colons (`:`), semicolons (`;`), and commas (`,`).

### `punctuation` (`object`)

An object that allows specifying different punctuation rules for different heading levels.

**Properties:**

- `default` (optional): The default punctuation characters for all heading levels. If not specified, uses `".,;:!。、，；：！｡､"`.
- `1` to `6` (optional): Punctuation characters for a specific heading level.
- `1-3`, `4-6`, etc. (optional): Punctuation characters for a range of heading levels.

**Example:**

```json
{
  "punctuation": {
    "default": ".,;:!",
    "4-6": ""
  }
}
```

This configuration would:

- Check h1, h2, and h3 headings for `.`, `,`, `;`, `:`, `!` punctuation
- Allow any punctuation for h4, h5, and h6 headings (empty string means no check)

This is useful when using h4-h6 headings as emphasis-like elements where punctuation is intentional.
