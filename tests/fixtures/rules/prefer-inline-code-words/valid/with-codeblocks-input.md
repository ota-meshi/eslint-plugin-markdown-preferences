# Programming Tools

This guide covers various programming tools and technologies.

## Static Analysis

`ESLint` is a popular linting tool for `JavaScript` and `TypeScript`.

## Package Management

You can use `npm` to manage your `Node.js` dependencies.

## Multiple Words

Both `ESLint` and `TypeScript` are essential tools for modern development.

## Code Blocks

```javascript
// ESLint configuration
module.exports = {
  rules: {
    // TypeScript specific rules
  }
};
```

When `ESLint` and `TypeScript` appear in code blocks, they don't need to be in inline code.
